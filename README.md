- 🎮 I’m also working on making a story-driven emotional game where the journey explores memory, regret, and cosmic themes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **machine learning for astrophysics** and **advanced statistical methods**.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **astronomy research projects** or **software development for scientific applications**.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **finding summer research opportunities in observational astrophysics**.  
- 💬 Ask me about **Java, Python, R, or anything space-related!**  
- 📫 How to reach me: **ahnafamer.2022@gmail.com**  
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: To a distant observer, someone falling into a black hole never actually crosses the event horizon! 🚀⏳ Due to gravitational time dilation, they appear to slow down, redshift, and fade away—forever frozen at the edge. But from their own perspective, they fall right in! 🤯🌌
